# ShowDurability
Mod for the game "Starsand" which just came out on steam in early access.

Shows a healthbar below items like the axe to visualize the remaining livespan of the tool.

## How does it work?

Install either [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) or [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) and install the mod from there.
